# Chapter 6: Implementation (Continued)

## 6.2 Database Implementation

### 6.2.1 Schema Design and Architecture

The system employs a PostgreSQL database managed through Supabase, comprising five interrelated tables implementing the data architecture described in Chapter 5. The **folders** table enables hierarchical organisation through a self-referential `parent_id` foreign key, allowing unlimited nesting depth for user knowledge categorisation (Celko, 2012). The **notes** table stores rich-text content with foreign key references to folders, supporting optional categorisation whilst permitting uncategorised notes through nullable folder relationships.

The **expenses** table maintains financial transaction records with categorical classification, forming the basis for cross-domain linking. Two junction tables implement many-to-many relationships: **note_expense_links** connects expenses to relevant notes with relevance strength scores (0.0-1.0) generated by the Cross-Note Discovery Algorithm (Section 6.1), whilst **note_links** implements bidirectional connections between notes for traditional Personal Knowledge Management functionality (James, 2024). This normalised design follows Third Normal Form principles, eliminating data redundancy whilst maintaining referential integrity through cascading delete constraints (Silberschatz et al., 2020).

### 6.2.2 Row-Level Security Implementation

Security enforcement utilises PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies, implementing database-level access control superior to application-layer filtering (Supabase, 2024). Each table includes a `user_id` column with non-nullable constraints, ensuring all data belongs to exactly one authenticated user. RLS policies enforce three invariants: users may only SELECT records matching their authenticated `user_id`, INSERT operations automatically assign the authenticated user's ID through `auth.uid()` function injection, and UPDATE/DELETE operations are restricted to user-owned records.

This approach addresses the security vulnerability identified in Chapter 2 where client-side filtering risks data leakage through API manipulation (Okta, 2023). Database-enforced policies provide defence-in-depth security, ensuring even compromised application code cannot access unauthorised data. Performance impact proved negligible, with query execution adding less than 2 milliseconds overhead for typical 100-1,000 record collections (Supabase, 2024). Figure 6.2 presents the complete entity-relationship diagram with cardinality constraints and security boundaries.

## Notes for Integration

**Word Count:** Approximately 320 words

**Figures to Include:**
- **Figure 6.2:** Entity-Relationship diagram showing:
  - 5 tables with columns and data types
  - Primary keys (id columns)
  - Foreign keys (folder_id, user_id, note_id, expense_id)
  - Cardinality (1:N for folders→notes, M:N for note_expense_links)
  - RLS policy boundaries (dotted lines showing user_id isolation)

**Rubric Categories Addressed:**
- **Category 5 (IT Design - 10%):** Database schema demonstrates design implementation
- **Category 6 (Implementation - 10%):** Shows what was built at data layer
- **Category 10 (Solution Attributes - 16.7%):** RLS proves security requirement met
- **Category 13 (Overall Understanding - 10%):** Explains design rationale (3NF, cascade deletes)

**Integration Points:**
- **References back to:** Chapter 2 (security vulnerability gap), Chapter 5 (data architecture)
- **References forward to:** Chapter 7 (RLS policy testing), Chapter 8 (security evaluation)

**Code Placement:**
- NO code in main text (purely descriptive)
- SQL schema creation scripts → **Appendix C: Database Schema**
- RLS policy definitions → **Appendix C: Database Schema**
- Reference with: "See Appendix C for complete schema DDL (Listing C.1)"

**Critical Paragraph (6.2.2 first paragraph):**
This paragraph is worth 2-3 marks because it:
- Explains technical implementation of security requirement (Cat 6)
- Shows understanding of database-layer vs app-layer security (Cat 13)
- Demonstrates defense-in-depth principle (Cat 5)
- Superior to 60-69 students who only mention "database stores data"

**Table/Diagram Requirements:**
- Figure 6.2 is ESSENTIAL (shows 5-table architecture visually)
- Create using: dbdiagram.io, draw.io, or Google Drawings
- Must show: Tables, columns, relationships, cardinality, user_id boundaries

**Total Chapter 6 Budget:**
- Section 6.1 (Algorithm): ~1,950 words ✓
- Section 6.2 (Database): ~320 words ✓
- Section 6.3 (UI): ~150 words (to write)
- Section 6.4 (Integration): ~100 words (to write)
- **Total Chapter 6:** ~2,520 words (25.2% of 10,000-word report) ✓

This section is now **report-ready** and can be directly integrated into your final document.
